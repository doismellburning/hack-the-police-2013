				<h2>Background</h2>

                                <p>The Commissioner's 100 is a growing movement of front-line, can-do Metropolitan Police officers and staff
                                who want to improve the MPS from the bottom-up with ideas that have the potential and can be
                                 given the green light without becoming ensnared in never-ending red-tape that means they
                                never the see the light of day.</p>

                                <p>The Commissioner embraced this group in July 2012 and attends all our events because he wants to meet
                                front-line officers and hear their ideas for how we can make the MPS an even more effective organisation.</p>

                                <p>We have run five events so far, and numerous spin off projects have developed from the Commissioner's 100.</p>

				<h2>Technology and innovation</h2>
				<p>At the 4th Commissioner's 100, colleagues outlined a vision of just how policing could be through proper
				   use of technology, and simple innovations that would save us immense amounts of time and money.</p>
				<p>We considered the current provision of technology, which means that
				   officers must spend a significant proportion of their time travelling
				   to and from the police station between jobs - just to copy out
				   information from their pocket notebooks into a computer system before
				   they could get back to helping people.</p>

				<p>The solutions we proposed are practical and will deliver staggering
				   cost-savings over a very short period of time.</p>

			  	<p>The hack day is all about demonstrating to all levels of command
				   just how much can be achieved quickly and easily, without lengthy
				   and costly painful procurement processes and bureaucracy.</p>
