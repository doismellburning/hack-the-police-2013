                    <p>
                        The field of mobile policing is still evolving,
                        and we are still working on best practises in
                        this area. This will be an ongoing conversation
                        that we look forward to having with you at the
                        hackathon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before the hack, this page will
                        show what we consider to be the essentials -
                        the basic requirements for an app that may
                        need to store sensitive and personal data.

                    <p>
                        We want you to be as creative as possible
                        using the skills that come to you fastest
                        and easiest -- but if you want a suggestion
                        for a framework to work in, read on:

                        If you're building a mobile app, please
                        consider building it in a device-agnostic
                        fashion - perhaps as a mobile HTML5 app,
                        using frameworks such as
                        <a target="_blank" href="http://jquerymobile.com/">jQuery Mobile</a>
                        and/or <a target="_blank" href="http://cordova.apache.org/">Cordova</a>.

                    <p>
                        Sensitive information has to be handled
                        carefully and kept secure.
                    </p>
		    <p>
			We've mocked up a remote storage solution - called RecordStore,
			which your mobile apps can use to store and retrieve objects. 
		    </p>
		    <p>
			For the purposes of the hack (fast development, ease of access),
			the record store has not been secured - nor is it a production
			application. We've hacked it together to be representative of the
			functionality you might find in production solutions, and
			to help you get stuck-in to creating apps as quickly as possible.

			APIs, read the
