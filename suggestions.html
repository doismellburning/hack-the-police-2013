                        We asked Metropolitan Police officers
                        what ideas they could think of for
                        apps to help them and the public to
                        help keep London safe. Here's what
                        they came up with!
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Of course, some ideas are just too
                        big to cover in a hack, and your own
                        ideas and passion will help you to
                        decide what you want to make.
