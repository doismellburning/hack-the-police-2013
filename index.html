                Software developers and designers were invited to<br/>
                bring their unique talents to the fight against crime!

              <h2>The story so far...</h2>
              
		<p>We want to improve how Police can help people, and how people can help themselves - through exploring the potential of mobile apps.</p>
		<p>We have some data and a lot of practical real-world problems to solve: what we need is talented developers who want to solve problems.</p>
		<p>Although there's no money, there will be prizes, and a good chance that your app will be used by front-line officers to help people who
		   really need it (or by members of the public to help themselves).</p>

              <h2>Who are we?</h2>
              <p>
                This event is being facilitated by a group of front-line
                officers from the Metropolitan Police, called the 
		<a href="c100.html">Commissioner's 100</a>,
		who are exploring
                great new ways the police can help everybody to live
                safer lives.
              </p>
              <p>
                We feel that good use of technology
                is a key part of this and want to engage with the development
                community to find solutions that will provide lasting benefits
                to the public.
              </p>
              <p>
                This forms a part of the Commissioner's
                <a href="http://content.met.police.uk/Site/totalpolicing" target="_blank">Total Policing</a> strategy.
                We want to prevent crime, catch criminals, and provide a better service to
                victims of crime wherever we can.
              </p>
